## Divolte-confluent

Starts: 

- a (patched) Divolte-collector (dcd/divolte-collector)
- a Confluent Schema-registry (confluent/schema-registry) & Zookeeper (confluent/zookeeper)
- a statsD-enabled Kafka (dcd/kafka)

Docker images need to be pulled (for the conluent images) or build (for the dcd images, see https://github.com/insidin/docker-recipes)
